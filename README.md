This project focuses on predicting whether a customer would recommend a product based on their review. We started by reproducing the project by [janhavi-giri](https://github.com/janhavi-giri/Predictive-Analysis-Ecommerce), then made enhancements to improve model performance and ensure the whole process is fully reproducible.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews)  
- **Rows**: 23,486  
- **Target Column**: `Recommended IND` (1 = Recommended, 0 = Not Recommended)

---

## Objectives

- Develop a binary classification model to predict product recommendations.
- Enhance reproducibility.
- Improve upon the original project using better:
  - Data preprocessing  
  - Feature engineering  
  - Feature selection  
  - Model optimization

---

## Workflow Overview

### 1. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** (`DP_FE.ipynb`)
- Dropped rows with missing or irrelevant values.
- Cleaned and lemmatized text.
- Created new features:
  - `review_length` (from cleaned review text)
  - `sentiment_score` (using VADER)
- Used one-hot encoding and TF-IDF.
- Saved processed train/test datasets.

### 2. **Feature Selection & Modeling** (`FS_Model.ipynb`)
- Scaled numeric features.
- Removed highly correlated variables (> 0.85).
- Selected top 300 features using Random Forest importance + Mutual Information.
- Tuned Random Forest model using GridSearchCV.

## üÜö Comparison with Original

| Category           | Original Project        | Our Version                      |
|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Text Processing    | Basic                   | Cleaned, lemmatized, sentiment   |
| Feature Engineering| Limited                 | New features + TF-IDF            |
| Feature Selection  | Not systematic          | Combined RF + MI                 |
| Model Tuning       | Not specified           | GridSearchCV                     |
